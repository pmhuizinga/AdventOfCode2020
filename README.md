<h1 id="day1">Day 1: Report Repair</h1>
After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.

The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.

To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.

Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

1721
979
366
299
675
1456
In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

Your puzzle answer was 713184.

--- Part Two ---
The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find three numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.

Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979, 366, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.

In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?

You land at the regional airport in time for your next flight. In fact, it looks like you'll even have time to
grab some food: all flights are currently delayed due to issues in luggage processing.

Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents;
bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody
responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!

For example, consider the following rules:

light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
faded blue bags contain no other bags.
dotted black bags contain no other bags.
These rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types. In this example, every faded blue bag is empty, every
vibrant plum bag contains 11 bags (5 faded blue and 6 dotted black), and so on.

You have a shiny gold bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors
would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one
shiny gold bag?)

In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:

A bright white bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly.
A muted yellow bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly, plus some other bags.
A dark orange bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny
gold bag.
A light red bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your
shiny gold bag. So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one shiny
gold bag is 4.

How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag? (The list of rules is quite long;
make sure you get all of it.)
